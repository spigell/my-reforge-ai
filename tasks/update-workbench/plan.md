# Task

- repo: spigell/hh-responder
- kind: feature
- idea: Update workbench to use sync-hub

# Goal & Non-Goals

- Goal: Integrate sync-hub functionality into the workbench to enable real-time synchronization of data.
- Non-Goals:
    - Re-architecting existing workbench components not directly related to sync-hub integration.
    - Implementing new features beyond core synchronization.

# Deliverables

- [ ] Modified workbench configuration to enable sync-hub.
- [ ] Updated codebase to utilize sync-hub for data synchronization.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for sync-hub integration.

# Approach

- Summary: Identify existing data flow in the workbench, integrate sync-hub client, adapt data models for synchronization, and add necessary configuration.
- Affected paths (target repo): TBD
- Interfaces/IO: Workbench configuration, sync-hub client API, existing data models.
- Security/Secrets: Use existing secret management for sync-hub credentials.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workbench successfully connects to sync-hub.
- [ ] Data changes in the workbench are synchronized via sync-hub.
- [ ] Data consistency is maintained across synchronized instances.

# Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Data conflicts during synchronization → Mitigation: Implement robust conflict resolution strategies.
- Risk: Performance degradation due to sync-hub overhead → Mitigation: Optimize data transfer and processing.

# Rollout & Review

- Planning via this PR in the tasks repo.
- Implementation will open a new PR in `spigell/hh-responder` after approval.
