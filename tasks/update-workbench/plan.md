# Task

- repo: spigell/hh-responder
- kind: feature
- idea: Update workbench to use sync-hub

# Goal & Non-Goals

- Goal: Integrate sync-hub functionality into the workbench to enable synchronized data updates.
- Non-Goals:
    - Implement new data models for sync-hub.
    - Modify existing core business logic unrelated to data synchronization.

# Deliverables

- [ ] Updated workbench configuration to enable sync-hub.
- [ ] Modified code to utilize sync-hub for data synchronization.
- [ ] Unit tests for sync-hub integration.

# Approach

- Summary: Identify areas in the workbench that require data synchronization, integrate the sync-hub client, and update relevant components to use sync-hub for data exchange.
- Affected paths (target repo): TBD
- Interfaces/IO: sync-hub client, existing workbench APIs
- Security/Secrets: Use existing MCP-provided service credentials for sync-hub authentication.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workbench successfully connects to sync-hub.
- [ ] Data updates are synchronized through sync-hub.
- [ ] Existing workbench functionality remains intact after sync-hub integration.

# Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Compatibility issues with existing workbench components → Mitigation: Thorough testing and incremental integration.
- Risk: Performance degradation due to sync-hub overhead → Mitigation: Monitor performance metrics and optimize sync-hub usage.

# Rollout & Review

- Planning via this PR in the tasks repo.
- Implementation will open a new PR in `spigell/hh-responder` after approval.
