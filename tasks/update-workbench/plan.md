# Task

- repo: spigell/hh-responder
- kind: feature
- idea: Update workbench to use sync-hub

# Goal & Non-Goals

- Goal: Integrate sync-hub into the workbench environment to streamline development and deployment processes for the `hh-responder` project.
- Non-Goals:
    - Re-architecting the core `hh-responder` application logic.
    - Migrating existing data or configurations not directly related to workbench synchronization.
    - Implementing new features within `hh-responder` itself.

# Deliverables

- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/base/kustomization.yml` to include sync-hub configurations.
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/codex/codex-config.toml` to reflect sync-hub integration.
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/user-bootstrap.sh` to initialize sync-hub.
- [ ] Verification steps for sync-hub functionality in the workbench.

# Approach

- Summary: Modify the existing Kubernetes deployment configurations and bootstrap scripts within the `deploy/develop` directory to incorporate sync-hub. This will involve adding sync-hub related resources to `kustomization.yml`, updating `codex-config.toml` for agent permissions, and modifying `user-bootstrap.sh` to ensure sync-hub is properly set up and started.
- Affected paths (target repo):
    - `deploy/develop/base/kustomization.yml`
    - `deploy/develop/overrides/codex/codex-config.toml`
    - `deploy/develop/overrides/user-bootstrap.sh`
- Interfaces/IO: Kubernetes configurations, shell scripts, Codex agent permissions.
- Security/Secrets: No new secrets will be introduced or exposed. Existing MCP-provided service credentials will be utilized.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The workbench environment starts successfully with sync-hub integrated.
- [ ] `hh-responder` can be built and run within the sync-hub enabled workbench.
- [ ] Changes made in the workbench are correctly synchronized by sync-hub.
- [ ] No regressions are introduced to existing workbench functionalities.

# Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Sync-hub integration causes conflicts with existing workbench configurations. → Mitigation: Thorough testing in a development environment and careful review of configuration changes.
- Risk: Performance degradation due to sync-hub overhead. → Mitigation: Monitor resource usage and performance metrics after integration.

# Rollout & Review

- Planning via this PR in the tasks repo.
- Implementation will open a new PR in `spigell/hh-responder` after approval.
