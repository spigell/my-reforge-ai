# Task

- repo: spigell/hh-responder
- kind: feature
- idea: Update workbench to use sync-hub

# Goal & Non-Goals

- Goal: To update the workbench deployment configuration to utilize `sync-hub` for improved synchronization and resource management.
- Non-Goals: Refactoring existing application logic, changing core application features, or modifying other deployment environments.

# Deliverables

- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/base/kustomization.yml` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/base/workbench.yaml` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/kustomization.yml` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/patch-nfs-and-user.yaml` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/pvc.yaml` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/user-bootstrap.sh` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Updated `deploy/develop/overrides/codex/codex-config.toml` in `spigell/hh-responder`
- [ ] Verification steps for `sync-hub` integration.

# Approach

- Summary: Modify the existing Kubernetes deployment files in the `deploy/develop` directory to integrate `sync-hub`. This will involve updating `kustomization.yml` files to include `sync-hub` related resources, and potentially modifying `workbench.yaml` and other override files to reflect the new synchronization mechanism.
- Affected paths (target repo): `deploy/develop/base/kustomization.yml`, `deploy/develop/base/workbench.yaml`, `deploy/develop/overrides/kustomization.yml`, `deploy/develop/overrides/patch-nfs-and-user.yaml`, `deploy/develop/overrides/pvc.yaml`, `deploy/develop/overrides/user-bootstrap.sh`, `deploy/develop/overrides/codex/codex-config.toml`
- Interfaces/IO: Kubernetes configuration files.
- Security/Secrets: No new secrets or security concerns are anticipated. Existing secrets management should remain unchanged.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The workbench deploys successfully with `sync-hub` enabled.
- [ ] `sync-hub` correctly synchronizes files as expected.
- [ ] No regressions are introduced in the workbench functionality.

# Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: `sync-hub` integration causes deployment failures or unexpected behavior. → Mitigation: Thorough testing in a development environment and rollback plan.
- Risk: Compatibility issues with existing workbench components. → Mitigation: Review `sync-hub` documentation and test incrementally.

# Rollout & Review

- Planning via this PR in the tasks repo.
- Implementation will open a new PR in `spigell/hh-responder` after approval.
