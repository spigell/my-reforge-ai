# Operations Runbook

## Summary

Author an operations runbook detailing common troubleshooting steps, alert responses, and rollback procedures for the AI worker.

## Rationale

- Documentation currently emphasizes architecture but lacks actionable guidance for on-call engineers.
- A runbook accelerates incident response and reduces onboarding time for new contributors.

## Suggested Steps

1. Draft runbook structure covering task matcher issues, usage budget alerts, and MCP connectivity failures.
2. Capture command snippets, log file locations, and escalation paths.
3. Link runbook from README and team wiki to increase discoverability.
4. Schedule quarterly reviews to keep instructions current with infrastructure changes.

## Expected Impact

Improves operational readiness, reducing MTTR (mean time to recovery) when production issues arise.\*\*\*
