# Agent Failover Strategy

## Summary

Introduce a structured failover mechanism allowing the implementor to retry tasks with alternate agents when the preferred agent errors or times out.

## Rationale

- Tasks currently abort when the first agent fails, even if alternate agents are listed.
- Automated failover can eliminate manual restarts for transient provider outages.

## Suggested Steps

1. Extend `MatchedTask` to include prioritized agent queue (primary + fallbacks).
2. Update implementor CLI to loop through agents, honoring per-agent cooldowns.
3. Emit telemetry showing failover attempts, successes, and terminal failures.
4. Add tests covering timeout recovery and ensure usage limits are respected per agent invocation.

## Expected Impact

Higher task completion rate during partial outages and fewer manual interventions by operators.\*\*\*
